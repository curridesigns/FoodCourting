Hey Everyone,

Thought I would get started with a Read Me file. Just helps me gather some thought for a bigger project.

First and foremost, this is created entirely in Vanilla JS. If you have any questions about how something is done please check the Web API docs
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API
it is full of great resources for how stuff works, and the syntax for different things

This is a chatting game with a mini game that is a grab and place style game.

Our Main Character is a Ramen Resturatant in a mall Food Court Employee

For the mini game:
You run around the kitchen collecting ingredients and bringing them back to bowl, while avoiding your creepy manager.

For the chatting, we have 4 interactive characters:
Ted(Stalker/bad)
Raven(Goth/good)
Taylor(ex/bad)
Chad(Incel/Bad)

The game has 4 possible endings:
Stalker/murder ending with Ted (bad unless you want to die)
Band gig date ending with Raven (good)
Hanging with the Ex ending with Taylor (bad) 
Incel campaign ending with Chad (bad)

The endings will depend on how many chat events you have completed with each character
(The endings are launched after using all of the character's chat functions.) ?
