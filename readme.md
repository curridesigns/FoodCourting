Hey Everyone,

Thought I would get started with a Read Me file. Just helps me gather some thought for a bigger project.

So far we got a chatting game with one mini game that is either maze, or a grab and place style game.

Our Main Character is a Food Court Employee

For the mini game:
  You run around the kitchen collecting ingredients and bringing them back to bowl

For the chatting, we have 4 interactive characters:
Customer(Stalker/bad)
Spencer's Employee(Goth/good)
Other Food Court Employee(ex/bad)
Arcade Worker (Incel/Bad)

The game should have for possible endings:
Stalker's ending
Spencer's Ending
Ex's ending
Incel's ending

The endings will depend on what level of "Friendship" you have with each of the characters, and we'll have to talk about how to increase and decrease the "Friendship level."

Danny had a great idea of making the mini game first so we can make sure we have something to show by the end of the quarter, so we should definitely chat about that, preferably before Monday.
