Hey Everyone,

Thought I would get started with a Read Me file. Just helps me gather some thought for a bigger project.

So far we got a chatting game with one mini game that is either maze, or a grab and place style game.

Our Main Character is a Food 

For the mini game, we'll have to figure out the mechanics and the details

For the chatting, we have 4 interactive characters:
  Customer(Stalker)
  Spencer's Employee(good)
  Other Food Court Employee
