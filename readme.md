Hey Everyone,

Thought I would get started with a Read Me file. Just helps me gather some thought for a bigger project.

First and foremost, this is created entirely in Vanilla JS. If you have any questions about how something is done please check the Web API docs
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API
it is full of great resources for how stuff works, and the syntax for different things

This is a chatting game with a mini game that is a grab and place style game.

Our Main Character is a Ramen Resturatant in a mall Food Court Employee

For the mini game:
You run around the kitchen collecting ingredients and bringing them back to bowl
Need to figure out for sure if the ingredients are going to pop up in the same place, or in random spots throughout the kitchen

For the chatting, we have 4 interactive characters:
Ted(Stalker/bad)
Raven(Goth/good)
Taylor(ex/bad)
Chad(Incel/Bad)

The game should have 4 possible endings:
Stalker's ending
Spencer's Ending
Ex's ending
Incel's ending

The endings will depend on what level of "Friendship" you have with each of the characters, and we'll have to talk about how to increase and decrease the "Friendship level."

Danny had a great idea of making the mini game first so we can make sure we have something to show by the end of the quarter, so we should definitely chat about that, preferably before Monday.
